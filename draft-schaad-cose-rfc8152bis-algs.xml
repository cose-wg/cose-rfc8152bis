      <t>
        Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed for small code size and small message size. 
        There is a need for the ability to have basic security services defined for this data format. 
        This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol. 
        This specification describes how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR for serialization. 
        COSE additionally describes how to represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.
      </t>
      <t>
        In this specification the conventions for the use of a number of cryptographic algorithms with COSE.
        The details of the structure of COSE are defined in <xref target="I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document along with <xref target="I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/> obsoletes RFC8152.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction"  >
      <t>
        There has been an increased focus on small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT). 
        One of the standards that has come out of this process is "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)" <xref target="RFC7049"  />. 
        CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC7159"  /> by allowing for binary data, among other changes. 
        CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IoT world as their encoding of data structures. 
        CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size and be a schema-free decoder. 
        A need exists to provide message security services for IoT, and using CBOR as the message-encoding format makes sense.
      </t>

      <t>
        The core COSE specification consists of two documents.
        <xref target="I-D.schaad-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/> contains the serialization structures and the procedures for using the different cryptographic algorithms.
        This document provides for an initial set of algorithms that are then use with those structures.
        Additional algorithms beyond what are in this document are defined elsewhere.

      <section title="ECDSA" anchor="ECDSA"  >
        <t>ECDSA <xref target="DSS"  /> defines a signature algorithm using ECC.  Implementations SHOULD use a deterministic version of ECDSA such as the one defined in <xref target="RFC6979"  />.  The use of a deterministic signature algorithm allows for systems to avoid relying on random number generators in order to avoid generating the same value of 'k' (the per-message random value). Biased generation of the value 'k' can be attacked, and collisions of this value leads to leaked keys.  It additionally allows for doing deterministic tests for the signature algorithm.  The use of deterministic ECDSA does not lessen the need to have good random number generation when creating the private key.  </t>
        <t>The ECDSA signature algorithm is parameterized with a hash function (h).  In the event that the length of the hash function output is greater than the group of the key, the leftmost bytes of the hash output are used.  </t>
        <t>The algorithms defined in this document can be found in <xref target="table_ecdsa"  />.  </t>

        <t>This document defines ECDSA to work only with the curves P-256, P-384, and P-521.  This document requires that the curves be encoded using the 'EC2' (2 coordinate elliptic curve) key type.  Implementations need to check that the key type and curve are correct when creating and verifying a signature.  Other documents can define it to work with other curves and points in the future.  </t>

        <t>In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with curve P-256, SHA-384 be used only with curve P-384, and SHA-512 be used with curve P-521.  This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480"  />.  </t>

        <t>The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).  These integers will be the same length as the length of the key used for the signature process.  The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.  The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.  The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.  </t>

        <t>
          Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC8017"  />, the signature is: 
          <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n)
          <vspace blankLines="0"/>
          where n = ceiling(key_length / 8)
        </t>

        <t>When using a COSE key for this algorithm, the following checks are made: <list style="symbols">
<t>The 'kty' field MUST be present, and it MUST be 'EC2'.</t><t>If the 'alg' field is present, it MUST match the ECDSA signature algorithm being used.</t><t>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'sign' when creating an ECDSA signature.</t>

<t>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'verify' when verifying an ECDSA signature.</t></list> </t>
        <section title="Security Considerations"  >
          <t>The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.  </t>
          <t>Note: Use of deterministic signatures is a good idea even when good random number generation exists.  Doing so both reduces the possibility of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations and allows for reproducible signature values, which helps testing.  </t>

          <t>There are two substitution attacks that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.  <list style="symbols">
<t>Changing the curve used to validate the signature: If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have two messages with the same signature, each computed under a different curve.  The only requirement on the new curve is that its order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.  An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.  (Both are 256-bit curves.) We currently do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.  </t>

<t>Change the hash function used to validate the signature: If one either has two different hash functions of the same length or can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function (for example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value). As the hash algorithm is part of the signature algorithm identifier, this attack is mitigated by including a signature algorithm identifier in the protected header.  </t></list> </t>

      <section title="Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (EdDSAs)"  >
        <t><xref target="RFC8032"  /> describes the elliptic curve signature scheme Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  In that document, the signature algorithm is instantiated using parameters for edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.  The document additionally describes two variants of the EdDSA algorithm: Pure EdDSA, where no hash function is applied to the content before signing, and HashEdDSA, where a hash function is applied to the content before signing and the result of that hash function is signed.  For EdDSA, the content to be signed (either the message or the pre-hash value) is processed twice inside of the signature algorithm.  For use with COSE, only the pure EdDSA version is used.  This is because it is not expected that extremely large contents are going to be needed and, based on the arrangement of the message structure, the entire message is going to need to be held in memory in order to create or verify a signature.  This means that there does not appear to be a need to be able to do block updates of the hash, followed by eliminating the message from memory.  Applications can provide the same features by defining the content of the message as a hash value and transporting the COSE object (with the hash value) and the content as separate items.  </t>
        <t>The algorithms defined in this document can be found in <xref target="table-eddsa-algs"  />.  A single signature algorithm is defined, which can be used for multiple curves.  </t>

        This section defines the usages for two MAC algorithms.

      <section title="Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)"  >
        <t>HMAC <xref target="RFC2104"  /> <xref target="RFC4231"  /> was designed to deal with length extension attacks.  The algorithm was also designed to allow for new hash algorithms to be directly plugged in without changes to the hash function.  The HMAC design process has been shown as solid since, while the security of hash algorithms such as MD5 has decreased over time; the security of HMAC combined with MD5 has not yet been shown to be compromised <xref target="RFC6151"  />.  </t>

        <t>The HMAC algorithm is parameterized by an inner and outer padding, a hash function (h), and an authentication tag value length.  For this specification, the inner and outer padding are fixed to the values set in <xref target="RFC2104"  />.  The length of the authentication tag corresponds to the difficulty of producing a forgery.  For use in constrained environments, we define one HMAC algorithms that is truncated.  There are currently no known issues with truncation; however, the security strength of the message tag is correspondingly reduced in strength.  When truncating, the leftmost tag length bits are kept and transmitted.  </t>

          <t>Consideration was given to supporting smaller tag values; the constrained community would desire tag sizes in the 64-bit range.

      <section title="AES CCM"  >
        <t>CCM is a generic authentication encryption block cipher mode defined in <xref target="RFC3610"  />.  The CCM mode is combined with the AES block encryption algorithm to define a commonly used content encryption algorithm used in constrained devices.  </t>

        <t>The CCM mode has two parameter choices.  The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.  The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message growth (from the tag) and the probability that an attacker can undetectably modify a message.  The second choice is L, the size of the length field.  This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.  </t>

        <t>It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.  This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64 bits and not 8 bits.  These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.  This document will follow the convention of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.  </t>

        <t>We define a matrix of algorithms in this document over the values of L and M.  Constrained devices are usually operating in situations where they use short messages and want to avoid doing recipient-specific cryptographic operations.  This favors smaller values of both L and M.  Less-constrained devices will want to be able to use larger messages and are more willing to generate new keys for every operation.  This favors larger values of L and M.  </t>

        <t>The following values are used for L: <list style="hanging">

<t hangText="16 bits (2):">This limits messages to 2^16 bytes (64 KiB) in length.  This is sufficiently long for messages in the constrained world.  The nonce length is 13 bytes allowing for 2^(13*8) possible values of the nonce without repeating.  </t>

<t hangText="64 bits (8):">This limits messages to 2^64 bytes in length.  The nonce length is 7 bytes allowing for 2^56 possible values of the nonce without repeating.  </t></list> </t>
        <t>The following values are used for M: <list style="hanging">

<t hangText="64 bits (8):">This produces a 64-bit authentication tag.  This implies that there is a 1 in 2^64 chance that a modified message will authenticate.  </t>

<t hangText="128 bits (16):">This produces a 128-bit authentication tag.  This implies that there is a 1 in 2^128 chance that a modified message will authenticate.  </t></list> </t>

It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where portions of the plaintext are  highly predictable.  This reduces the security of the key size by half.  Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.  Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.  Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

        <t>The HKDF key derivation algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC5869"  />.  </t>
        <t>The HKDF algorithm takes these inputs: <list style="empty">

<t>secret -- a shared value that is secret.  Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement.  </t>

<t>salt -- an optional value that is used to change the generation process.  The salt value can be either public or private.  If the salt is public and carried in the message, then the 'salt' algorithm header parameter defined in <xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"  /> is used.  While <xref target="RFC5869"  /> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any amount of salt will improve the security as different key values will be generated.  This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.  The salt value does not need to be unique for every message sent.  </t>

<t>length -- the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.  </t>

<t>context information -- Information that describes the context in which the resulting value will be used.  Making this information specific to the context in which the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be tied to that usage.  The context structure defined in <xref target="context"  /> is used by the KDFs in this document.  </t>

<t>PRF -- The underlying pseudorandom function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.  The PRF is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.  However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF that is more appropriate in the constrained world.  Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.  When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.  For the AES algorithm versions, the extract step is always skipped.  </t>

        <t>The extract step cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example, if it is the result of an ECDH key agreement step. This implies that the AES HKDF version cannot be used with ECDH. If the extract step is skipped, the 'salt' value is not used as part of the HKDF functionality.  </t>

        <t>The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.  The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A"  />.  By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.  This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements, as it is done by the encoding used in JOSE (Section 4.6.2 of <xref target="RFC7518"  />).   </t>

        <t>The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties that are doing the key derivation.  Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.  By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.  </t>
       
        <t>The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.  This information can be obtained from a variety of sources: <list style="symbols"><t>Fields can be defined by the application.  This is commonly used to assign fixed names to parties, but it can be used for other items such as nonces.  </t>

<t>Fields can be defined by usage of the output.  Examples of this are the algorithm and key size that are being generated.  </t>

        <t>Fields can be defined by parameters from the message.  We define a set of parameters in <xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"  /> that can be used to carry the values associated with the context structure.  Examples of this are identities and nonce values.  These parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure; they do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure. </t></list> </t>

This practice means if algorithm A is broken and thus is easier to find, the key derived for algorithm B will not be the same as the key derived for algorithm A. </t>

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="identity:">This contains the identity information for party U.  The identities can be assigned in one of two manners.  First, a protocol can assign identities based on roles.  For example, the roles of "client" and "server" may be assigned to different entities in the protocol.  Each entity would then use the correct label for the data they send or receive.  The second way for a protocol to assign identities is to use a name based on a naming system (i.e., DNS, X.509 names). 
 
<vspace blankLines="1"/> We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU identity' that can be used to carry identity information in the message.  However, identity information is often known as part of the protocol and can thus be inferred rather than made explicit.  If identity information is carried in the message, applications SHOULD have a way of validating the supplied identity information.  The identity information does not need to be specified and is set to nil in that case.  </t>

<t hangText="nonce:">This contains a nonce value.  The nonce can either be implicit from the protocol or be carried as a value in the unprotected headers. 
 
<vspace blankLines="1"/> We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU nonce' that can be used to carry this value in the message; however, the nonce value could be determined by the application and the value determined from elsewhere.

<t hangText="keyDataLength:">This is set to the number of bits of the desired output value.  This practice means if algorithm A can use two different key lengths, the key derived for longer key size will not contain the key for shorter key size as a prefix. </t>

          <t>These keys need to be dedicated to a single algorithm.  There have been a number of attacks developed over time when a single key is used for multiple different algorithms.  One example of this is the use of a single key for both the CBC encryption mode and the CBC-MAC authentication mode.  </t>

      <section title="Direct Key with KDF" anchor="direct-kdf"  >
        <t>These recipient algorithms take a common shared secret between the two parties and applies the HKDF function (<xref target="HKDF"  />), using the context structure defined in <xref target="context"  /> to transform the shared secret into the CEK. 

        The 'protected' field can be of non-zero length.  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.  The salt/nonce parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically.  The requirement is that it be a unique value for the shared secret in question.  </t>

        <t>If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF.  While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.  If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique, and thus there is no length requirement.  </t>

        <t>A new IV must be used for each message if the same key is used.  The IV can be modified in a predictable manner, a random manner, or an unpredictable manner (i.e., encrypting a counter).  </t>
        <t>The IV used for a key can also be generated from the same HKDF functionality as the key is generated.  If HKDF is used for generating the IV, the algorithm identifier is set to "IV-GENERATION".  </t>

      <section title="Direct ECDH" anchor="ECDH"  >
        <t>The mathematics for ECDH can be found in <xref target="RFC6090"  />.  In this document, the algorithm is extended to be used with the two curves defined in <xref target="RFC7748"  />.  </t>

        <t>ECDH is parameterized by the following: <list style="symbols">
        <t>Curve Type/Curve: The curve selected controls not only the size of the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared secret.  The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve is represented and what happens for the identity points on the curve.  In this specification, we allow for a number of different curves to be used.  A set of curves are defined in <xref target="table-ec-curves"  />. 
        <vspace blankLines="0"/> The math used to obtain the computed secret is based on the curve selected and not on the ECDH algorithm.  For this reason, a new algorithm does not need to be defined for each of the curves.  </t>

        <t>Computed Secret to Shared Secret: Once the computed secret is known, the resulting value needs to be converted to a byte string to run the KDF.  The x-coordinate is used for all of the curves defined in this document.  For curves X25519 and X448, the resulting value is used directly as it is a byte string of a known length.  For the P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves, the x-coordinate is run through the I2OSP function defined in <xref target="RFC8017"  />, using the same computation for n as is defined in <xref target="ECDSA"  />.  </t>

        <t>Ephemeral-Static or Static-Static: The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key for the sender's side.  When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.  The ephemeral key is placed in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be present for all algorithm identifiers that use ephemeral keys.  When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new random value or create a unique value. 
        For the KDFs used, this means either the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"  />) or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context structure (<xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"  />) MUST be present (both can be present if desired). The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the pair of keys being used.  It is acceptable to use a global counter that is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.  When using static keys, the static key should be identified to the recipient.  The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').  Both of these parameters are defined in <xref target="table-ecdh-es-parameter-table"  />.  </t>

        <t>Key Derivation Algorithm: The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret.  As such, it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.  Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of context material: how the key is going to be used and one-time material for static-static key agreement.  All of the algorithms defined in this document use one of the HKDF algorithms defined in <xref target="HKDF"  /> with the context structure defined in <xref target="context"  />.  </t>

        <t>Key Wrap Algorithm: No key wrap algorithm is used.  This is represented in <xref target="table-ecdh-es-table"  /> as 'none'.  The key size for the context structure is the content layer encryption algorithm size.  </t></list> </t>

          <t>There is a method of checking that points provided from external entities are valid.  For the 'EC2' key format, this can be done by checking that the x and y values form a point on the curve.  For the 'OKP' format, there is no simple way to do point validation.  </t>
          <t>Consideration was given to requiring that the public keys of both entities be provided as part of the key derivation process (as recommended in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC7748"  />). This was not done as COSE is used in a store and forward format rather than in online key exchange.  In order for this to be a problem, either the receiver public key has to be chosen maliciously or the sender has to be malicious.  In either case, all security evaporates anyway.  </t>

          <t>The traditional way of sending ECs has been to send either both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate or the x-coordinate and a sign bit for the y-coordinate.  The latter encoding has not been recommended in the IETF due to potential IPR issues.

      <section title="Expert Review Instructions" anchor="review"  >
        <t>All of the IANA registries established in this document are defined as expert review.  This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason, so they should be given substantial latitude.  </t>
        <t>Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points: <list style="symbols">

<t>Point squatting should be discouraged.  Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered, and that the point is likely to be used in deployments.  The zones tagged as private use are intended for testing purposes and closed environments; code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.  </t>

<t>Specifications are required for the standards track range of point assignment.  Specifications should exist for specification required ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible.  Specifications are needed for the first-come, first-serve range if they are expected to be used outside of closed environments in an interoperable way.  When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.  </t>

<t>Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment.  The fact that there is a range for standards track documents does not mean that a standards track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range.  The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size. </t>

<t>When algorithms are registered, vanity registrations should be discouraged.  One way to do this is to require registrations to provide additional documentation on security analysis of the algorithm.  Another thing that should be considered is requesting an opinion on the algorithm from the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).  Algorithms that do not meet the security requirements of the community and the messages structures should not be registered.  </t></list> </t>
</section>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations"  >
      <t>There are a number of security considerations that need to be taken into account by implementers of this specification.  The security considerations that are specific to an individual algorithm are placed next to the description of the algorithm.  While some considerations have been highlighted here, additional considerations may be found in the documents listed in the references.  </t>

      <t>Implementations need to protect the private key material for any individuals.  There are some cases in this document that need to be highlighted on this issue.  <list style="symbols">
<t>Using the same key for two different algorithms can leak information about the key.  It is therefore recommended that keys be restricted to a single algorithm.  </t>
<t>Use of 'direct' as a recipient algorithm combined with a second recipient algorithm exposes the direct key to the second recipient.  </t>
<t>Several of the algorithms in this document have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking information about the key.  </t></list> </t>

      <t>The use of ECDH and direct plus KDF (with no key wrap) will not directly lead to the private key being leaked; the one way function of the KDF will prevent that.  There is, however, a different issue that needs to be addressed.  Having two recipients requires that the CEK be shared between two recipients.  The second recipient therefore has a CEK that was derived from material that can be used for the weak proof of origin.  The second recipient could create a message using the same CEK and send it to the first recipient; the first recipient would, for either static-static ECDH or direct plus KDF, make an assumption that the CEK could be used for proof of origin even though it is from the wrong entity.  If the key wrap step is added, then no proof of origin is implied and this is not an issue.  </t>

      <t>Although it has been mentioned before, the use of a single key for multiple algorithms has been demonstrated in some cases to leak information about a key, provide the opportunity for attackers to forge integrity tags, or gain information about encrypted content.  Binding a key to a single algorithm prevents these problems.  Key creators and key consumers are strongly encouraged not only to create new keys for each different algorithm, but to include that selection of algorithm in any distribution of key material and strictly enforce the matching of algorithms in the key structure to algorithms in the message structure.  In addition to checking that algorithms are correct, the key form needs to be checked as well.  Do not use an 'EC2' key where an 'OKP' key is expected.  </t>

      <t>Before using a key for transmission, or before acting on information received, a trust decision on a key needs to be made.  Is the data or action something that the entity associated with the key has a right to see or a right to request? A number of factors are associated with this trust decision.  Some of the ones that are highlighted here are: <list style="symbols">
<t>What are the permissions associated with the key owner?</t>

<t>Is the cryptographic algorithm acceptable in the current context?</t>

<t>Have the restrictions associated with the key, such as algorithm or freshness, been checked and are they correct?</t>

<t>Is the request something that is reasonable, given the current state of the application?</t>
<t>Have any security considerations that are part of the message been enforced (as specified by the application or 'crit' parameter)?</t></list> </t>

      <t>There are a large number of algorithms presented in this document that use nonce values.  For all of the nonces defined in this document, there is some type of restriction on the nonce being a unique value either for a key or for some other conditions.  In all of these cases, there is no known requirement on the nonce being both unique and unpredictable; under these circumstances, it's reasonable to use a counter for creation of the nonce.  In cases where one wants the pattern of the nonce to be unpredictable as well as unique, one can use a key created for that purpose and encrypt the counter to produce the nonce value.  </t>

      <t>One area that has been starting to get exposure is doing traffic analysis of encrypted messages based on the length of the message.  This specification does not provide for a uniform method of providing padding as part of the message structure.  An observer can distinguish between two different strings (for example, 'YES' and 'NO') based on the length for all of the content encryption algorithms that are defined in this document.  This means that it is up to the applications to document how content padding is to be done in order to prevent or discourage such analysis.  (For example, the strings could be defined as 'YES' and 'NO '.) </t>

    <section anchor="examples" title="Examples"  >

      <t>A GitHub project has been created at &lt;https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples&gt; that contains not only the examples presented in this document, but a more complete set of testing examples as well.  Each example is found in a JSON file that contains the inputs used to create the example, some of the intermediate values that can be used in debugging the example and the output of the example presented in both a hex and a CBOR diagnostic notation format.  Some of the examples at the site are designed failure testing cases; these are clearly marked as such in the JSON file.  If errors in the examples in this document are found, the examples on GitHub will be updated, and a note to that effect will be placed in the JSON file.  </t>
