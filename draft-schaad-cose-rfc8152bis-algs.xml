      <t>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the ability to have basic security services defined for this data format.  This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol.  This specification describes how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR for serialization.  This specification additionally describes how to represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.  </t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>There has been an increased focus on small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT).  One of the standards that has come out of this process is "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)" <xref target="RFC7049" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC7159" pageno="false" format="default"/> by allowing for binary data, among other changes.  CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IoT world as their encoding of data structures.  CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size and be a schema-free decoder.  A need exists to provide message security services for IoT, and using CBOR as the message-encoding format makes sense.  </t>

      <t>The JOSE working group produced a set of documents <xref target="RFC7515" pageno="false" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7516" pageno="false" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7517" pageno="false" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7518" pageno="false" format="default"/> using JSON that specified how to process encryption, signatures, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) operations and how to encode keys using JSON.  This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) standard, which does the same thing for the CBOR encoding format.  While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) documents, two considerations are taken into account: </t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
<t>CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and are appropriate to use.  One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64-encoded string.  </t>
<t>COSE is not a direct copy of the JOSE specification.  In the process of creating COSE, decisions that were made for JOSE were re-examined.  In many cases, different results were decided on as the criteria were not always the same.  </t></list> </t>

      <section anchor="design-changes-from-jose" title="Design Changes from JOSE" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t><list style="symbols">
<t>Define a single top message structure so that encrypted, signed, and MACed messages can easily be identified and still have a consistent view.  </t><t>Signed messages distinguish between the protected and unprotected parameters that relate to the content from those that relate to the signature. </t>
<t>MACed messages are separated from signed messages.  </t>
<t>MACed messages have the ability to use the same set of recipient algorithms as enveloped messages for obtaining the MAC authentication key.  </t>

      <section anchor="cbor-grammar" title="CBOR Grammar" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>There is currently no standard CBOR grammar available for use by specifications.  The CBOR structures are therefore described in prose.  </t>
        <t>The document was developed by first working on the grammar and then developing the prose to go with it.  An artifact of this is that the prose was written using the primitive type strings defined by CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="CDDL" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  In this specification, the following primitive types are used:
 <list style="empty">
<t>any -- non-specific value that permits all CBOR values to be placed here.</t>
<t>bool -- a boolean value (true: major type 7, value 21; false: major type 7, value 20).</t>
<t>bstr -- byte string (major type 2).</t>
<t>int -- an unsigned integer or a negative integer.</t>
<t>nil -- a null value (major type 7, value 22).</t>
<t>nint -- a negative integer (major type 1).</t>
<t>tstr -- a UTF-8 text string (major type 3).</t>
<t>uint -- an unsigned integer (major type 0).</t></list> </t>

        <t>Two syntaxes from CDDL appear in this document as shorthand.  These are: <list style="empty">
<t>FOO / BAR -- indicates that either FOO or BAR can appear here.</t>
<t>[+ FOO] -- indicates that the type FOO appears one or more times in an array.</t></list> </t>

        <t>As well as the prose description, a version of a CBOR grammar is presented in CDDL.  Since CDDL has not been published in an RFC, this grammar may not work with the final version of CDDL.  The CDDL grammar is informational; the prose description is normative.  </t>

        <t>The collected CDDL can be extracted from the XML version of this document via the following XPath expression below.  (Depending on the XPath evaluator one is using, it may be necessary to deal with &amp;gt; as an entity.) </t>

        <t>In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a string.  In COSE, we use strings, negative integers, and unsigned integers as map keys.  The integers are used for compactness of encoding and easy comparison.  The inclusion of strings allows for an additional range of short encoded values to be used as well.  Since the word "key" is mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the term "label" for this usage as a map key.  </t>

        <t>The presence of a label in a COSE map that is not a string or an integer is an error.  Applications can either fail processing or process messages with incorrect labels; however, they MUST NOT create messages with incorrect labels.  </t>

        <t>In this document, we use the following terminology: </t>
        <t>Byte is a synonym for octet.</t>
        <t>Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use in constrained systems.  It is defined in <xref target="RFC7252" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

        <t>Authenticated Encryption (AE) <xref target="RFC5116" pageno="false" format="default"/> algorithms are those encryption algorithms that provide an authentication check of the contents algorithm with the encryption service.  </t>

        <t>Authenticated Encryption with Authenticated Data (AEAD) <xref target="RFC5116" pageno="false" format="default"/> algorithms provide the same content authentication service as AE algorithms, but they additionally provide for authentication of non-encrypted data as well.  </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="the-cosemsg-structure" title="Basic COSE Structure" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>The COSE object structure is designed so that there can be a large amount of common code when parsing and processing the different types of security messages.  All of the message structures are built on the CBOR array type.  The first three elements of the array always contain the same information: <list style="numbers">
<t>The set of protected header parameters wrapped in a bstr.</t>
<t>The set of unprotected header parameters as a map.</t>
<t>The content of the message.  The content is either the plaintext or the ciphertext as appropriate.  The content may be detached, but the location is still used.  The content is wrapped in a bstr when present and is a nil value when detached.  </t></list> 

Elements after this point are dependent on the specific message type.  </t>

      <t>COSE messages are also built using the concept of layers to separate different types of cryptographic concepts.  As an example of how this works, consider the COSE_Encrypt message (<xref target="EnvelopedData" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  This message type is broken into two layers: the content layer and the recipient layer.  In the content layer, the plaintext is encrypted and information about the encrypted message is placed.  In the recipient layer, the content encryption key (CEK) is encrypted and information about how it is encrypted for each recipient is placed.  A single layer version of the encryption message COSE_Encrypt0 (<xref target="EnvelopedData0" pageno="false" format="default"/>) is provided for cases where the CEK is pre-shared.  </t>

      <t>Identification of which type of message has been presented is done by the following methods: <list style="numbers">
<t>The specific message type is known from the context.  This may be defined by a marker in the containing structure or by restrictions specified by the application protocol.  </t>
<t>The message type is identified by a CBOR tag.  Messages with a CBOR tag are known in this specification as tagged messages, while those without the CBOR tag are known as untagged messages.  This document defines a CBOR tag for each of the message structures.  These tags can be found in <xref target="CBOR-Tags" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

<t>When a COSE object is carried in a media type of 'application/cose', the optional parameter 'cose-type' can be used to identify the embedded object.  The parameter is OPTIONAL if the tagged version of the structure is used.  The parameter is REQUIRED if the untagged version of the structure is used.  The value to use with the parameter for each of the structures can be found in <xref target="CBOR-Tags" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t><t>When a COSE object is carried as a CoAP payload, the CoAP Content-Format Option can be used to identify the message content.  The CoAP Content-Format values can be found in <xref target="CoAP_content_type" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  The CBOR tag for the message structure is not required as each security message is uniquely identified.  </t></list> </t>

    <section anchor="header-parameters" title="Header Parameters" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>The structure of COSE has been designed to have two buckets of information that are not considered to be part of the payload itself, but are used for holding information about content, algorithms, keys, or evaluation hints for the processing of the layer.  These two buckets are available for use in all of the structures except for keys.  While these buckets are present, they may not all be usable in all instances.  For example, while the protected bucket is defined as part of the recipient structure, some of the algorithms used for recipient structures do not provide for authenticated data.  If this is the case, the protected bucket is left empty.  </t>
      <t>Both buckets are implemented as CBOR maps.  The map key is a 'label' (<xref target="label" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  The value portion is dependent on the definition for the label.  Both maps use the same set of label/value pairs.  The integer and string values for labels have been divided into several sections including a standard range, a private range, and a range that is dependent on the algorithm selected.  The defined labels can be found in the "COSE Header Parameters" IANA registry (<xref target="cose-header-key-table" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  </t>
      <t>Two buckets are provided for each layer: <list style="hanging">
<t hangText="protected:">Contains parameters about the current layer that are to be cryptographically protected.  This bucket MUST be empty if it is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.  This bucket is encoded in the message as a binary object.  This value is obtained by CBOR encoding the protected map and wrapping it in a bstr object.  Senders SHOULD encode a zero-length map as a zero-length string rather than as a zero-length map (encoded as h'a0').  The zero-length binary encoding is preferred because it is both shorter and the version used in the serialization structures for cryptographic computation.  After encoding the map, the value is wrapped in the binary object.  Recipients MUST accept both a zero-length binary value and a zero-length map encoded in the binary value.  The wrapping allows for the encoding of the protected map to be transported with a greater chance that it will not be altered in transit.  (Badly behaved intermediates could decode and re-encode, but this will result in a failure to verify unless the re-encoded byte string is identical to the decoded byte string.) This avoids the problem of all parties needing to be able to do a common canonical encoding.  </t>

<t hangText="unprotected:">Contains parameters about the current layer that are not cryptographically protected.  </t></list> Only parameters that deal with the current layer are to be placed at that layer.  As an example of this, the parameter 'content type' describes the content of the message being carried in the message.  As such, this parameter is placed only in the content layer and is not placed in the recipient or signature layers.  In principle, one should be able to process any given layer without reference to any other layer.  With the exception of the COSE_Sign structure, the only data that needs to cross layers is the cryptographic key.  </t>

      <t>The buckets are present in all of the security objects defined in this document.  The fields in order are the 'protected' bucket (as a CBOR 'bstr' type) and then the 'unprotected' bucket (as a CBOR 'map' type).  The presence of both buckets is required.  The parameters that go into the buckets come from the IANA "COSE Header Parameters" registry (<xref target="cose-header-key-table" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  Some common parameters are defined in the next section, but a number of parameters are defined throughout this document.  </t>

      <t>Labels in each of the maps MUST be unique.  When processing messages, if a label appears multiple times, the message MUST be rejected as malformed.  Applications SHOULD verify that the same label does not occur in both the protected and unprotected headers.  If the message is not rejected as malformed, attributes MUST be obtained from the protected bucket before they are obtained from the unprotected bucket.  </t>

      <t>The following CDDL fragment represents the two header buckets.  A group "Headers" is defined in CDDL that represents the two buckets in which attributes are placed.  This group is used to provide these two fields consistently in all locations.  A type is also defined that represents the map of common headers.  </t>

      <section anchor="cose-headers" title="Common COSE Headers Parameters" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>This section defines a set of common header parameters.  A summary of these parameters can be found in <xref target="Header-Table" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  This table should be consulted to determine the value of label and the type of the value.  </t>

        <t>The set of header parameters defined in this section are: </t>
        <t><list style="hanging"><t hangText="alg:"> This parameter is used to indicate the algorithm used for the security processing.  This parameter MUST be authenticated where the ability to do so exists.  This support is provided by AEAD algorithms or construction (COSE_Sign, COSE_Sign0, COSE_Mac, and COSE_Mac0).  This authentication can be done either by placing the header in the protected header bucket or as part of the externally supplied data.  The value is taken from the "COSE Algorithms" registry (see <xref target="cose-algorithm-registry" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  </t>

<t hangText="crit:">The parameter is used to indicate which protected header labels an application that is processing a message is required to understand.  Parameters defined in this document do not need to be included as they should be understood by all implementations.  When present, this parameter MUST be placed in the protected header bucket.  The array MUST have at least one value in it.  

<vspace blankLines="0"/> Not all labels need to be included in the 'crit' parameter.  The rules for deciding which header labels are placed in the array are: <list style="symbols">

<t>Integer labels in the range of 0 to 8 SHOULD be omitted.</t>

<t>Integer labels in the range -1 to -128 can be omitted as they are algorithm dependent.  If an application can correctly process an algorithm, it can be assumed that it will correctly process all of the common parameters associated with that algorithm.  Integer labels in the range -129 to -65536 SHOULD be included as these would be less common parameters that might not be generally supported.  </t>

<t>Labels for parameters required for an application MAY be omitted.  Applications should have a statement if the label can be omitted.  </t></list>

 The header parameter values indicated by 'crit' can be processed by either the security library code or an application using a security library; the only requirement is that the parameter is processed.  If the 'crit' value list includes a value for which the parameter is not in the protected bucket, this is a fatal error in processing the message.  </t>

<t hangText="content type:">This parameter is used to indicate the content type of the data in the payload or ciphertext fields.  Integers are from the "CoAP Content-Formats" IANA registry table <xref target="COAP.Formats" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  Text values following the syntax of "&lt;type-name&gt;/&lt;subtype-name&gt;" where &lt;type-name&gt; and &lt;subtype-name&gt; are defined in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC6838" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  Leading and trailing whitespace is also omitted.  Textual content values along with parameters and subparameters can be located using the IANA "Media Types" registry.  Applications SHOULD provide this parameter if the content structure is potentially ambiguous.  </t>

<t hangText="kid:">This parameter identifies one piece of data that can be used as input to find the needed cryptographic key.  The value of this parameter can be matched against the 'kid' member in a COSE_Key structure.  Other methods of key distribution can define an equivalent field to be matched.  Applications MUST NOT assume that 'kid' values are unique.  There may be more than one key with the same 'kid' value, so all of the keys associated with this 'kid' may need to be checked.  The internal structure of 'kid' values is not defined and cannot be relied on by applications.  Key identifier values are hints about which key to use.  This is not a security-critical field.  For this reason, it can be placed in the unprotected headers bucket.  </t>

<t hangText="IV:">This parameter holds the Initialization Vector (IV) value.  For some symmetric encryption algorithms, this may be referred to as a nonce.  The IV can be placed in the unprotected header as modifying the IV will cause the decryption to yield plaintext that is readily detectable as garbled.  </t>

<t hangText="Partial IV:">This parameter holds a part of the IV value.  When using the COSE_Encrypt0 structure, a portion of the IV can be part of the context associated with the key.  This field is used to carry a value that causes the IV to be changed for each message.  The IV can be placed in the unprotected header as modifying the IV will cause the decryption to yield plaintext that is readily detectable as garbled.  The 'Initialization Vector' and 'Partial Initialization Vector' parameters MUST NOT both be present in the same security layer.

<vspace blankLines="1"/> The message IV is generated by the following steps:
<list style="numbers">

<t>Left-pad the Partial IV with zeros to the length of IV.</t>

<t>XOR the padded Partial IV with the context IV.</t></list> </t>

<t hangText="counter signature:">This parameter holds one or more counter signature values.  Counter signatures provide a method of having a second party sign some data.  The counter signature parameter can occur as an unprotected attribute in any of the following structures: COSE_Sign1, COSE_Signature, COSE_Encrypt, COSE_recipient, COSE_Encrypt0, COSE_Mac, and COSE_Mac0.  These structures all have the same beginning elements, so that a consistent calculation of the counter signature can be computed.  Details on computing counter signatures are found in <xref target="counter_signature" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

      <t>COSE supports two different signature structures.  COSE_Sign allows for one or more signatures to be applied to the same content. COSE_Sign1 is restricted to a single signer.  The structures cannot be converted between each other; as the signature computation includes a parameter identifying which structure is being used, the converted structure will fail signature validation.  </t>
      <section title="Signing with One or More Signers" anchor="full-signature" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>The COSE_Sign structure allows for one or more signatures to be applied to a message payload. Parameters relating to the content and parameters relating to the signature are carried along with the signature itself.  These parameters may be authenticated by the signature, or just present.  An example of a parameter about the content is the content type.  Examples of parameters about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to create the signature and counter signatures.  </t>

<t>RFC 5652 indicates that:

<list><t>When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a successful signature by that signer.  However, there are some application environments where other rules are needed.  An application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for each signer must specify those rules.  Also, where simple matching of the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the signatures were generated by the same signer, the application specification must describe how to determine which signatures were generated by the same signer.  Support for different communities of recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more than one signature.</t></list></t>

<t>
For example, the COSE_Sign structure might include signatures generated with the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) <xref target="RFC8032" pageno="false" format="default"/> and with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <xref target="DSS" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  This allows recipients to verify the signature associated with one algorithm or the other. More-detailed information on multiple signature evaluations can be found in <xref target="RFC5752" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

        <t>The signature structure can be encoded as either tagged or untagged depending on the context it will be used in.  A tagged COSE_Sign structure is identified by the CBOR tag 98.  The CDDL fragment that represents this is: </t>

      <section title="Externally Supplied Data" anchor="Extern_AAD" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>One of the features offered in the COSE document is the ability for applications to provide additional data to be authenticated, but that is not carried as part of the COSE object.  The primary reason for supporting this can be seen by looking at the CoAP message structure <xref target="RFC7252" pageno="false" format="default"/>, where the facility exists for options to be carried before the payload.  Examples of data that can be placed in this location would be the CoAP code or CoAP options.  If the data is in the header section, then it is available for proxies to help in performing its operations.  For example, the Accept Option can be used by a proxy to determine if an appropriate value is in the proxy's cache.  But the sender can prevent a proxy from changing the set of values that it will accept by including that value in the resulting authentication tag.  However, it may also be desired to protect these values so that if they are modified in transit, it can be detected.  </t>

        <t>This document describes the process for using a byte array of externally supplied authenticated data; however, the method of constructing the byte array is a function of the application.  Applications that use this feature need to define how the externally supplied authenticated data is to be constructed.  Such a construction needs to take into account the following issues: 
<list style="symbols">

<t>If multiple items are included, applications need to ensure that the same byte string is not produced if there are different inputs.  This could occur by appending the strings 'AB' and 'CDE' or by appending the strings 'ABC' and 'DE'.  This is usually addressed by making fields a fixed width and/or encoding the length of the field as part of the output.  Using options from CoAP <xref target="RFC7252" pageno="false" format="default"/> as an example, these fields use a TLV structure so they can be concatenated without any problems.  </t>

<t>If multiple items are included, an order for the items needs to be defined.  Using options from CoAP as an example, an application could state that the fields are to be ordered by the option number.  </t>

<t>Applications need to ensure that the byte stream is going to be the same on both sides.  Using options from CoAP might give a problem if the same relative numbering is kept.  An intermediate node could insert or remove an option, changing how the relative number is done.  An application would need to specify that the relative number must be re-encoded to be relative only to the options that are in the external data.  </t></list> </t>

      <section anchor="counter_signature" title="Computing Counter Signatures" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>Counter signatures provide a method of associating a different signature generated by different signers with some piece of content.  This is normally used to provide a signature on a signature allowing for a proof that a signature existed at a given time (i.e., a Timestamp).  In this document, we allow for counter signatures to exist in a greater number of environments.  As an example, it is possible to place a counter signature in the unprotected attributes of a COSE_Encrypt object.  This would allow for an intermediary to either verify that the encrypted byte stream has not been modified, without being able to decrypt it, or assert that an encrypted byte stream either existed at a given time or passed through it in terms of routing (i.e., a proxy signature).  </t>

        <t>An example of a counter signature on a signature can be found in <xref target="Appendix_B_1_3" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  An example of a counter signature in an encryption object can be found in <xref target="Appendix_B_3_3" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>
        <t>The creation and validation of counter signatures over the different items relies on the fact that the objects have the same structure.  The elements are a set of protected attributes, a set of unprotected attributes, and a body, in that order.  This means that the Sig_structure can be used in a uniform manner to get the byte stream for processing a signature.  If the counter signature is going to be computed over a COSE_Encrypt structure, the body_protected and payload items can be mapped into the Sig_structure in the same manner as from the COSE_Sign structure.  </t>

        <t>It should be noted that only a signature algorithm with appendix (see <xref target="SigAlgs" pageno="false" format="default"/>) can be used for counter signatures.  This is because the body should be able to be processed without having to evaluate the counter signature, and this is not possible for signature schemes with message recovery.  </t>

      <t>COSE supports two different MAC structures.  COSE_MAC0 is used when a recipient structure is not needed because the key to be used is implicitly known.  COSE_MAC is used for all other cases.  These include a requirement for multiple recipients, the key being unknown, and a recipient algorithm of other than direct.  </t>
      <t>In this section, we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing MAC authentication in COSE.  This document allows for the use of all of the same classes of recipient algorithms as are allowed for encryption.  </t>

      <t>When using MAC operations, there are two modes in which they can be used.  The first is just a check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed.  Any class of recipient algorithm can be used for this purpose.  The second mode is to both check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed and to use the recipient algorithm to verify who sent it.  The classes of recipient algorithms that support this are those that use a pre-shared secret or do static-static (SS) key agreement (without the key wrap step).  In both of these cases, the entity that created and sent the message MAC can be validated.  (This knowledge of the sender assumes that there are only two parties involved and that you did not send the message to yourself.) The origination property can be obtained with both of the MAC message structures.  </t>

    <section title="Signature Algorithms" anchor="SigAlgs" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>There are two signature algorithm schemes.  The first is signature with appendix.  In this scheme, the message content is processed and a signature is produced; the signature is called the appendix.  This is the scheme used by algorithms such as ECDSA and the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS).  (In fact, the SSA in RSASSA-PSS stands for Signature Scheme with Appendix.) </t>
      <t>The signature functions for this scheme are: </t>

   signature = Sign(message content, key)

   valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)
</artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>The second scheme is signature with message recovery (an example of such an algorithm is <xref target="PVSig" pageno="false" format="default"/>). In this scheme, the message content is processed, but part of it is included in the signature.  Moving bytes of the message content into the signature allows for smaller signatures; the signature size is still potentially large, but the message content has shrunk.  This has implications for systems implementing these algorithms and for applications that use them.  The first is that the message content is not fully available until after a signature has been validated.  Until that point, the part of the message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.  The second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature is very much based on the structure of the message content.  Messages that are highly predictable require additional randomness to be supplied as part of the signature process.  In the worst case, it becomes the same as doing a signature with appendix.  Finally, in the event that multiple signatures are applied to a message, all of the signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same number of bytes of message content.  This means that the mixing of the different schemes in a single message is not supported, and if a recovery signature scheme is used, then the same amount of content needs to be consumed by all of the signatures.  </t>

      <t>Signature algorithms are used with the COSE_Signature and COSE_Sign1 structures.  At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use with COSE; however, considerable interest has been expressed in using a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size reduction that is possible.

      <section title="ECDSA" anchor="ECDSA" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>ECDSA <xref target="DSS" pageno="false" format="default"/> defines a signature algorithm using ECC.  Implementations SHOULD use a deterministic version of ECDSA such as the one defined in <xref target="RFC6979" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  The use of a deterministic signature algorithm allows for systems to avoid relying on random number generators in order to avoid generating the same value of 'k' (the per-message random value). Biased generation of the value 'k' can be attacked, and collisions of this value leads to leaked keys.  It additionally allows for doing deterministic tests for the signature algorithm.  The use of deterministic ECDSA does not lessen the need to have good random number generation when creating the private key.  </t>

        <t>This document defines ECDSA to work only with the curves P-256, P-384, and P-521.  This document requires that the curves be encoded using the 'EC2' (2 coordinate elliptic curve) key type.  Implementations need to check that the key type and curve are correct when creating and verifying a signature.  Other documents can define it to work with other curves and points in the future.  </t>

        <t>In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with curve P-256, SHA-384 be used only with curve P-384, and SHA-512 be used with curve P-521.  This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

        <t>The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).  These integers will be the same length as the length of the key used for the signature process.  The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.  The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.  The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.  </t>

        <t>Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC8017" pageno="false" format="default"/>, the signature is: 
<vspace blankLines="0"/> Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n) <vspace blankLines="0"/> where n = ceiling(key_length / 8) </t>

        <t>When using a COSE key for this algorithm, the following checks are made: <list style="symbols">
<t>The 'kty' field MUST be present, and it MUST be 'EC2'.</t><t>If the 'alg' field is present, it MUST match the ECDSA signature algorithm being used.</t><t>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'sign' when creating an ECDSA signature.</t>

<t>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it MUST include 'verify' when verifying an ECDSA signature.</t></list> </t>

          <t>The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.  </t>
          <t>Note: Use of this technique is a good idea even when good random number generation exists.  Doing so both reduces the possibility of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations and allows for reproducible signature values, which helps testing.  </t>

          <t>There are two substitution attacks that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.  <list style="symbols">
<t>Changing the curve used to validate the signature: If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have two messages with the same signature, each computed under a different curve.  The only requirement on the new curve is that its order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.  An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.  (Both are 256-bit curves.) We currently do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.  </t>

<t>Change the hash function used to validate the signature: If one either has two different hash functions of the same length or can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function (for example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value). As the hash algorithm is part of the signature algorithm identifier, this attack is mitigated by including a signature algorithm identifier in the protected header.  </t></list> </t>

In that document, the signature algorithm is instantiated using parameters for edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.  The document additionally describes two variants of the EdDSA algorithm: Pure EdDSA, where no hash function is applied to the content before signing, and HashEdDSA, where a hash function is applied to the content before signing and the result of that hash function is signed.  For EdDSA, the content to be signed (either the message or the pre-hash value) is processed twice inside of the signature algorithm.  For use with COSE, only the pure EdDSA version is used.  This is because it is not expected that extremely large contents are going to be needed and, based on the arrangement of the message structure, the entire message is going to need to be held in memory in order to create or verify a signature.  This means that there does not appear to be a need to be able to do block updates of the hash, followed by eliminating the message from memory.  Applications can provide the same features by defining the content of the message as a hash value and transporting the COSE object (with the hash value) and the content as separate items.  </t>

        <t>The CCM mode has two parameter choices.  The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.  The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message growth (from the tag) and the probability that an attacker can undetectably modify a message.  The second choice is L, the size of the length field.  This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.  </t>

        <t>It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.  This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64 bits and not 8 bits.  These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.  This document will follow the convention of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.  </t>

It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where portions of the plaintext are  highly predictable.  This reduces the security of the key size by half.  Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.  Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.  Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

    <section title="Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>KDFs are used to take some secret value and generate a different one.  The secret value comes in three flavors: <list style="symbols"><t>Secrets that are uniformly random:  This is the type of secret that is created by a good random number generator.</t><t>Secrets that are not uniformly random: This is type of secret that is created by operations like key agreement.</t>

<t>Secrets that are not random: This is the type of secret that people generate for things like passwords.</t></list> </t>
      <t>General KDFs work well with the first type of secret, can do reasonably well with the second type of secret, and generally do poorly with the last type of secret.  None of the KDFs in this section are designed to deal with the type of secrets that are used for passwords.  Functions like PBES2 <xref target="RFC8018" pageno="false" format="default"/> need to be used for that type of secret.  </t>

      <t>The same KDF can be set up to deal with the first two types of secrets in a different way.  The KDF defined in <xref target="HKDF" pageno="false" format="default"/> is such a function.  This is reflected in the set of algorithms defined for the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF).  </t>

      <t>When using KDFs, one component that is included is context information.  Context information is used to allow for different keying information to be derived from the same secret.  The use of context-based keying material is considered to be a good security practice.  </t>

      <t>This document defines a single context structure and a single KDF.  These elements are used for all of the recipient algorithms defined in this document that require a KDF process.  These algorithms are defined in Sections <xref target="direct-kdf" pageno="false" format="counter"/>, <xref target="ECDH" pageno="false" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="ECDH-wrap" pageno="false" format="counter"/>.  </t>

      <section title="HMAC-Based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)" anchor="HKDF" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>The HKDF key derivation algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC5869" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>
        <t>The HKDF algorithm takes these inputs: <list style="empty">

<t>secret -- a shared value that is secret.  Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement.  </t>

<t>salt -- an optional value that is used to change the generation process.  The salt value can be either public or private.  If the salt is public and carried in the message, then the 'salt' algorithm header parameter defined in <xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params" pageno="false" format="default"/> is used.  While <xref target="RFC5869" pageno="false" format="default"/> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any amount of salt will improve the security as different key values will be generated.  This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.  The salt value does not need to be unique for every message sent.  </t>

<t>length -- the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.  </t>

<t>context information -- Information that describes the context in which the resulting value will be used.  Making this information specific to the context in which the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be tied to that usage.  The context structure defined in <xref target="context" pageno="false" format="default"/> is used by the KDFs in this document.  </t>

<t>PRF -- The underlying pseudorandom function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.  The PRF is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.  However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF that is more appropriate in the constrained world.  Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.  When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.  For the AES algorithm versions, the extract step is always skipped.  </t>

        <t>The extract step cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example, if it is the result of an ECDH key agreement step. This implies that the AES HKDF version cannot be used with ECDH. If the extract step is skipped, the 'salt' value is not used as part of the HKDF functionality.  </t>

      <section title="Context Information Structure" anchor="context" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.  The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.  This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements, as it is done by the encoding used in JOSE (Section 4.6.2 of <xref target="RFC7518" pageno="false" format="default"/>).   </t>

        <t>The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties that are doing the key derivation.  Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.  By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.  </t>
       
        <t>The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.  This information can be obtained from a variety of sources: <list style="symbols"><t>Fields can be defined by the application.  This is commonly used to assign fixed names to parties, but it can be used for other items such as nonces.  </t>

<t>Fields can be defined by usage of the output.  Examples of this are the algorithm and key size that are being generated.  </t>

        <t>Fields can be defined by parameters from the message.

Examples of this are identities and nonce values.  These parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure; they do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure. </t></list> </t>

 The 'protected' field can be of non-zero length.  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.  The salt/nonce parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically.  The requirement is that it be a unique value for the shared secret in question.  </t>

If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique, and thus there is no length requirement.  </t>

Key wrap mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.  This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data that has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

      <section title="Direct Key Agreement" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>The 'direct key agreement' class of recipient algorithms uses a key agreement method to create a shared secret.  A KDF is then applied to the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.  This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see <xref target="three-layer" pageno="false" format="default"/>).  </t>
        <t>The most commonly used key agreement algorithm is Diffie-Hellman, but other variants exist.  Since COSE is designed for a store and forward environment rather than an online environment, many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message cannot provide any dynamic key material.  One side effect of this is that perfect forward secrecy (see <xref target="RFC4949" pageno="false" format="default"/>) is not achievable.  A static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE object.  </t>
        <t>Two variants of DH that are supported are: <list>
<t>Ephemeral-Static (ES) DH: where the sender of the message creates a one-time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.  The use of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.  </t>

<t>Static-Static DH: where a static key is used for both the sender and the recipient.  The use of static keys allows for the recipient to get a weak version of data origination for the message.  When static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique data for the KDF is required to ensure that a different key is created for each message.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>When direct key agreement mode is used, there MUST be only one recipient in the message.  This method creates the key directly, and that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.  If multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap needs to be used.  </t>

        <t>The COSE_Encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows: </t>

        <t><list style="symbols"><t>At a minimum, headers  MUST contain the 'alg' parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the recipient's asymmetric key.  </t><t>The headers SHOULD identify the sender's key for the static-static versions and MUST contain the sender's ephemeral key for the ephemeral-static versions.  </t></list> </t>
        <section title="ECDH" anchor="ECDH" numbered="yes" toc="default">
          <t>The mathematics for ECDH can be found in <xref target="RFC6090" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  In this document, the algorithm is extended to be used with the two curves defined in <xref target="RFC7748" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

          <t>ECDH is parameterized by the following: <list style="symbols">
<t>Curve Type/Curve: The curve selected controls not only the size of the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared secret.  The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve is represented and what happens for the identity points on the curve.  In this specification, we allow for a number of different curves to be used.  A set of curves are defined in <xref target="table-ec-curves" pageno="false" format="default"/>. 
 <vspace blankLines="0"/> The math used to obtain the computed secret is based on the curve selected and not on the ECDH algorithm.  For this reason, a new algorithm does not need to be defined for each of the curves.  </t>

<t>Computed Secret to Shared Secret: Once the computed secret is known, the resulting value needs to be converted to a byte string to run the KDF.  The x-coordinate is used for all of the curves defined in this document.  For curves X25519 and X448, the resulting value is used directly as it is a byte string of a known length.  For the P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves, the x-coordinate is run through the I2OSP function defined in <xref target="RFC8017" pageno="false" format="default"/>, using the same computation for n as is defined in <xref target="ECDSA" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

<t>Ephemeral-Static or Static-Static: The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key for the sender's side.  When using ephemeral keys, the sender MUST generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.  The ephemeral key is placed in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and MUST be present for all algorithm identifiers that use ephemeral keys.  When using static keys, the sender MUST either generate a new random value or create a unique value. 
For the KDFs used, this means either the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params" pageno="false" format="default"/>) or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context structure (<xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params" pageno="false" format="default"/>) MUST be present (both can be present if desired). The value in the parameter MUST be unique for the pair of keys being used.  It is acceptable to use a global counter that is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.  When using static keys, the static key should be identified to the recipient.  The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').  Both of these parameters are defined in <xref target="table-ecdh-es-parameter-table" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

<t>Key Derivation Algorithm: The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret.  As such, it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.  Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of context material: how the key is going to be used and one-time material for static-static key agreement.  All of the algorithms defined in this document use one of the HKDF algorithms defined in <xref target="HKDF" pageno="false" format="default"/> with the context structure defined in <xref target="context" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

<t>Key Wrap Algorithm: No key wrap algorithm is used.  This is represented in <xref target="table-ecdh-es-table" pageno="false" format="default"/> as 'none'.  The key size for the context structure is the content layer encryption algorithm size.  </t></list> </t>

          <t>There is a method of checking that points provided from external entities are valid.  For the 'EC2' key format, this can be done by checking that the x and y values form a point on the curve.  For the 'OKP' format, there is no simple way to do point validation.  </t>
          <t>Consideration was given to requiring that the public keys of both entities be provided as part of the key derivation process (as recommended in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC7748" pageno="false" format="default"/>). This was not done as COSE is used in a store and forward format rather than in online key exchange.  In order for this to be a problem, either the receiver public key has to be chosen maliciously or the sender has to be malicious.  In either case, all security evaporates anyway.  </t>
          <t>A proof of possession of the private key associated with the public key is recommended when a key is moved from untrusted to trusted (either by the end user or by the entity that is responsible for making trust statements on keys). </t>

    <section title="Application Profiling Considerations" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>This document is designed to provide a set of security services, but not implementation requirements for specific usage.  The interoperability requirements are provided for how each of the individual services are used and how the algorithms are to be used for interoperability.  The requirements about which algorithms and which services are needed are deferred to each application.  </t>

      <t>An example of a profile can be found in <xref target="OSCOAP" pageno="false" format="default"/> where two profiles are being developed.  One is for carrying content by itself, and the other is for carrying content in combination with CoAP headers.  </t>

      <t>It is intended that a profile of this document be created that defines the interoperability requirements for that specific application.  This section provides a set of guidelines and topics that need to be considered when profiling this document.  <list style="symbols"><t>Applications need to determine the set of messages defined in this document that they will be using.  The set of messages corresponds fairly directly to the set of security services that are needed and to the security levels needed.  </t>

<t>Applications may define new header parameters for a specific purpose.  Applications will often times select specific header parameters to use or not to use.  For example, an application would normally state a preference for using either the IV or the Partial IV parameter.  If the Partial IV parameter is specified, then the application would also need to define how the fixed portion of the IV would be determined.  </t>

<t>When applications use externally defined authenticated data, they need to define how that data is encoded.  This document assumes that the data will be provided as a byte stream.  More information can be found in <xref target="Extern_AAD" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  </t>

<t>Applications need to determine the set of security algorithms that are to be used.  When selecting the algorithms to be used as the mandatory-to-implement set, consideration should be given to choosing different types of algorithms when two are chosen for a specific purpose.  An example of this would be choosing HMAC-SHA512 and AES-CMAC as different MAC algorithms; the construction is vastly different between these two algorithms.  This means that a weakening of one algorithm would be unlikely to lead to a weakening of the other algorithms.  Of course, these algorithms do not provide the same level of security and thus may not be comparable for the desired security functionality.  </t>

<t>Applications may need to provide some type of negotiation or discovery method if multiple algorithms or message structures are permitted.  The method can be as simple as requiring preconfiguration of the set of algorithms to providing a discovery method built into the protocol.  S/MIME provided a number of different ways to approach the problem that applications could follow: <list style="symbols"><t>Advertising in the message (S/MIME capabilities) <xref target="RFC5751" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

      <section title="Expert Review Instructions" anchor="review" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>All of the IANA registries established in this document are defined as expert review.  This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason, so they should be given substantial latitude.  </t>
        <t>Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points: <list style="symbols">

<t>Point squatting should be discouraged.  Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered, and that the point is likely to be used in deployments.  The zones tagged as private use are intended for testing purposes and closed environments; code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.  </t>

<t>Specifications are required for the standards track range of point assignment.  Specifications should exist for specification required ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible.  Specifications are needed for the first-come, first-serve range if they are expected to be used outside of closed environments in an interoperable way.  When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.  </t>

<t>Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment.  The fact that there is a range for standards track documents does not mean that a standards track document cannot have points assigned outside of that range.  The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size. </t>

<t>When algorithms are registered, vanity registrations should be discouraged.  One way to do this is to require registrations to provide additional documentation on security analysis of the algorithm.  Another thing that should be considered is requesting an opinion on the algorithm from the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).  Algorithms that do not meet the security requirements of the community and the messages structures should not be registered.  </t></list> </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>There are a number of security considerations that need to be taken into account by implementers of this specification.  The security considerations that are specific to an individual algorithm are placed next to the description of the algorithm.  While some considerations have been highlighted here, additional considerations may be found in the documents listed in the references.  </t>

      <t>Implementations need to protect the private key material for any individuals.  There are some cases in this document that need to be highlighted on this issue.  <list style="symbols">
<t>Using the same key for two different algorithms can leak information about the key.  It is therefore recommended that keys be restricted to a single algorithm.  </t>
<t>Use of 'direct' as a recipient algorithm combined with a second recipient algorithm exposes the direct key to the second recipient.  </t>
<t>Several of the algorithms in this document have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking information about the key.  </t></list> </t>

      <t>The use of ECDH and direct plus KDF (with no key wrap) will not directly lead to the private key being leaked; the one way function of the KDF will prevent that.  There is, however, a different issue that needs to be addressed.  Having two recipients requires that the CEK be shared between two recipients.  The second recipient therefore has a CEK that was derived from material that can be used for the weak proof of origin.  The second recipient could create a message using the same CEK and send it to the first recipient; the first recipient would, for either static-static ECDH or direct plus KDF, make an assumption that the CEK could be used for proof of origin even though it is from the wrong entity.  If the key wrap step is added, then no proof of origin is implied and this is not an issue.  </t>

      <t>Although it has been mentioned before, the use of a single key for multiple algorithms has been demonstrated in some cases to leak information about a key, provide the opportunity for attackers to forge integrity tags, or gain information about encrypted content.  Binding a key to a single algorithm prevents these problems.  Key creators and key consumers are strongly encouraged not only to create new keys for each different algorithm, but to include that selection of algorithm in any distribution of key material and strictly enforce the matching of algorithms in the key structure to algorithms in the message structure.  In addition to checking that algorithms are correct, the key form needs to be checked as well.  Do not use an 'EC2' key where an 'OKP' key is expected.  </t>

      <t>Before using a key for transmission, or before acting on information received, a trust decision on a key needs to be made.  Is the data or action something that the entity associated with the key has a right to see or a right to request? A number of factors are associated with this trust decision.  Some of the ones that are highlighted here are: <list style="symbols">
<t>What are the permissions associated with the key owner?</t>

<t>Is the cryptographic algorithm acceptable in the current context?</t>

<t>Have the restrictions associated with the key, such as algorithm or freshness, been checked and are they correct?</t>

<t>Is the request something that is reasonable, given the current state of the application?</t>
<t>Have any security considerations that are part of the message been enforced (as specified by the application or 'crit' parameter)?</t></list> </t>

      <t>There are a large number of algorithms presented in this document that use nonce values.  For all of the nonces defined in this document, there is some type of restriction on the nonce being a unique value either for a key or for some other conditions.  In all of these cases, there is no known requirement on the nonce being both unique and unpredictable; under these circumstances, it's reasonable to use a counter for creation of the nonce.  In cases where one wants the pattern of the nonce to be unpredictable as well as unique, one can use a key created for that purpose and encrypt the counter to produce the nonce value.  </t>

      <t>One area that has been starting to get exposure is doing traffic analysis of encrypted messages based on the length of the message.  This specification does not provide for a uniform method of providing padding as part of the message structure.  An observer can distinguish between two different strings (for example, 'YES' and 'NO') based on the length for all of the content encryption algorithms that are defined in this document.  This means that it is up to the applications to document how content padding is to be done in order to prevent or discourage such analysis.  (For example, the strings could be defined as 'YES' and 'NO '.) </t>

    <section title="Guidelines for External Data Authentication of Algorithms" numbered="yes" toc="default">
      <t>A portion of the working group has expressed a strong desire to relax the rule that the algorithm identifier be required to appear in each level of a COSE object.  There are two basic reasons that have been advanced to support this position.  First, the resulting message will be smaller if the algorithm identifier is omitted from the most common messages in a CoAP environment.  Second, there is a potential bug that will arise if full checking is not done correctly between the different places that an algorithm identifier could be placed (the message itself, an application statement, the key structure that the sender possesses, and the key structure the recipient possesses).  </t>

      <t>This appendix lays out how such a change can be made and the details that an application needs to specify in order to use this option.  Two different sets of details are specified: those needed to omit an algorithm identifier and those needed to use a variant on the counter signature attribute that contains no attributes about itself.  </t>

      <section title="Algorithm Identification" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>In this section, three sets of recommendations are laid out.  The first set of recommendations apply to having an implicit algorithm identified for a single layer of a COSE object.  The second set of recommendations apply to having multiple implicit algorithms identified for multiple layers of a COSE object.  The third set of recommendations apply to having implicit algorithms for multiple COSE object constructs.  </t>
        <t>The key words from RFC 2119 are deliberately not used here.  This specification can provide recommendations, but it cannot enforce them.  </t>
        <t>This set of recommendations applies to the case where an application is distributing a fixed algorithm along with the key information for use in a single COSE object.  This normally applies to the smallest of the COSE objects, specifically COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac0, and COSE_Encrypt0, but could apply to the other structures as well.  </t>
        <t>The following items should be taken into account: <list style="symbols">

<t>Applications need to list the set of COSE structures that implicit algorithms are to be used in.  Applications need to require that the receipt of an explicit algorithm identifier in one of these structures will lead to the message being rejected.  This requirement is stated so that there will never be a case where there is any ambiguity about the question of which algorithm should be used, the implicit or the explicit one.  This applies even if the transported algorithm identifier is a protected attribute.  This applies even if the transported algorithm is the same as the implicit algorithm.  </t>

<t>Applications need to define the set of information that is to be considered to be part of a context when omitting algorithm identifiers.  At a minimum, this would be the key identifier (if needed), the key, the algorithm, and the COSE structure it is used with.  Applications should restrict the use of a single key to a single algorithm.  As noted for some of the algorithms in this document, the use of the same key in different related algorithms can lead to leakage of information about the key, leakage about the data or the ability to perform forgeries.  </t>

<t>In many cases, applications that make the algorithm identifier implicit will also want to make the context identifier implicit for the same reason.  That is, omitting the context identifier will decrease the message size (potentially significantly depending on the length of the identifier).  Applications that do this will need to describe the circumstances where the context identifier is to be omitted and how the context identifier is to be inferred in these cases.  (An exhaustive search over all of the keys would normally not be considered to be acceptable.) An example of how this can be done is to tie the context to a transaction identifier.  Both would be sent on the original message, but only the transaction identifier would need to be sent after that point as the context is tied into the transaction identifier.  Another way would be to associate a context with a network address.  All messages coming from a single network address can be assumed to be associated with a specific context.  (In this case, the address would normally be distributed as part of the context.) </t>

<t>Applications cannot rely on key identifiers being unique unless they take significant efforts to ensure that they are computed in such a way as to create this guarantee.  Even when an application does this, the uniqueness might be violated if the application is run in different contexts (i.e., with a different context provider) or if the system combines the security contexts from different applications together into a single store.  </t>

<t>Applications should continue the practice of protecting the algorithm identifier.  Since this is not done by placing it in the protected attributes field, applications should define an application-specific external data structure that includes this value.  This external data field can be used as such for content encryption, MAC, and signature algorithms.  It can be used in the SuppPrivInfo field for those algorithms that use a KDF to derive a key value.  Applications may also want to protect other information that is part of the context structure as well.  It should be noted that those fields, such as the key or a Base IV, are protected by virtue of being used in the cryptographic computation and do not need to be included in the external data field.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>The second case is having multiple implicit algorithm identifiers specified for a multiple layer COSE object.  An example of how this would work is the encryption context that an application specifies, which contains a content encryption algorithm, a key wrap algorithm, a key identifier, and a shared secret.  The sender omits sending the algorithm identifier for both the content layer and the recipient layer leaving only the key identifier.  The receiver then uses the key identifier to get the implicit algorithm identifiers.  </t>

        <t>The following additional items need to be taken into consideration: <list style="symbols">
<t>Applications that want to support this will need to define a structure that allows for, and clearly identifies, both the COSE structure to be used with a given key and the structure and algorithm to be used for the secondary layer. The key for the secondary layer is computed as normal from the recipient layer.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>The third case is having multiple implicit algorithm identifiers, but targeted at potentially unrelated layers or different COSE objects.  There are a number of different scenarios where this might be applicable.  Some of these scenarios are: <list style="symbols">
<t>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  Each of the contexts is for use with a COSE_Encrypt message.  Each context will consist of distinct secret keys and IVs and potentially even different algorithms.  One context is for sending messages from party A to party B, and the second context is for sending messages from party B to party A.  This means that there is no chance for a reflection attack to occur as each party uses different secret keys to send its messages; a message that is reflected back to it would fail to decrypt.  </t>

<t>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  The first context is used for encryption of the message, and the second context is used to place a counter signature on the message.  The intention is that the second context can be distributed to other entities independently of the first context.  This allows these entities to validate that the message came from an individual without being able to decrypt the message and see the content.  </t>

<t>Two contexts are distributed as a pair.  The first context contains a key for dealing with MACed messages, and the second context contains a key for dealing with encrypted messages.  This allows for a unified distribution of keys to participants for different types of messages that have different keys, but where the keys may be used in a coordinated manner.  </t></list> </t>

        <t>For these cases, the following additional items need to be considered: <list style="symbols"><t>Applications need to ensure that the multiple contexts stay associated.  If one of the contexts is invalidated for any reason, all of the contexts associated with it should also be invalidated.  </t></list> </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Counter Signature without Headers" numbered="yes" toc="default">
        <t>There is a group of people who want to have a counter signature parameter that is directly tied to the value being signed, and thus the authenticated and unauthenticated buckets can be removed from the message being sent.  The focus on this is an even smaller size, as all of the information on the process of creating the counter signature is implicit rather than being explicitly carried in the message.  This includes not only the algorithm identifier as presented above, but also items such as the key identification, which is always external to the signature structure.  This means that the entities that are doing the validation of the counter signature are required to infer which key is to be used from context rather than being explicit.  One way of doing this would be to presume that all data coming from a specific port (or to a specific URL) is to be validated by a specific key.  (Note that this does not require that the key identifier be part of the value signed as it does not serve a cryptographic purpose.  If the key validates the counter signature, then it should be presumed that the entity associated with that key produced the signature.) </t>

        <t>When computing the signature for the bare counter signature header, the same Sig_structure defined in <xref target="Sig_structure" pageno="false" format="default"/> is used.  The sign_protected field is omitted, as there is no protected header field in this counter signature header.  The value of "CounterSignature0" is placed in the context field of the Sig_stucture.  </t>

    <section anchor="three-layer" title="Two Layers of Recipient Information" numbered="yes" toc="default">
<t>All of the currently defined recipient algorithm classes only use two layers of the COSE_Encrypt structure.  The first layer is the message content, and the second layer is the content key encryption.  However, if one uses a recipient algorithm such as the RSA Key Encapsulation Mechanism (RSA-KEM) (see Appendix A of RSA-KEM <xref target="RFC5990" pageno="false" format="default"/>), then it makes sense to have three layers of the COSE_Encrypt structure.  </t>

<t>These layers would be: <list style="symbols">
<t>Layer 0: The content encryption layer.  This layer contains the payload of the message.  </t>
<t>Layer 1: The encryption of the CEK by a KEK.  </t>
<t>Layer 2: The encryption of a long random secret using an RSA key and a key derivation function to convert that secret into the KEK.  </t></list> </t>
<t>This is an example of what a triple layer message would look like.  The message has the following layers: <list style="symbols">
<t>Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with AES-GCM using a 128-bit key.  </t>
<t>Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm with a 128-bit key.  </t>
<t>Layer 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the layer 1 key.  </t></list> In effect, this example is a decomposed version of using the ECDH&nbhy;ES+A128KW algorithm.  </t>
