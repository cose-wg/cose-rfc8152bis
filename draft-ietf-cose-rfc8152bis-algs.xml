        Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed for small code size and small message size. 
        There is a need for the ability to have basic security services defined for this data format. 
        This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol. 
        This specification describes how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR for serialization. 
        COSE additionally describes how to represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.
      </t>
      <t>
        In this specification the conventions for the use of a number of cryptographic algorithms with COSE.
        The details of the structure of COSE are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/>.
      </t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        There has been an increased focus on small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT). 
        One of the standards that has come out of this process is "Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)" <xref target="RFC7049"/>. 
        CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC8259"/> by allowing for binary data, among other changes. 
        CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IoT world as their encoding of data structures. 
        CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size and be a schema-free decoder. 
        A need exists to provide message security services for IoT, and using CBOR as the message-encoding format makes sense.
      </t>
      <t>
        The core COSE specification consists of two documents.
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/> contains the serialization structures and the procedures for using the different cryptographic algorithms.
        This document provides an initial set of algorithms for use with those structures.
        Additional algorithms beyond what are in this document are defined elsewhere.

      <section anchor="ECDSA">

        <name>ECDSA</name>
        <t>ECDSA <xref target="DSS"/> defines a signature algorithm using ECC.  Implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use a deterministic version of ECDSA such as the one defined in <xref target="RFC6979"/>.  The use of a deterministic signature algorithm allows for systems to avoid relying on random number generators in order to avoid generating the same value of 'k' (the per-message random value). Biased generation of the value 'k' can be attacked, and collisions of this value leads to leaked keys.  It additionally allows for doing deterministic tests for the signature algorithm.  The use of deterministic ECDSA does not lessen the need to have good random number generation when creating the private key.  </t>
        <t>The ECDSA signature algorithm is parameterized with a hash function (h).  In the event that the length of the hash function output is greater than the group of the key, the leftmost bytes of the hash output are used.  </t>

        <t>This document defines ECDSA to work only with the curves P-256, P-384, and P-521.  This document requires that the curves be encoded using the 'EC2' (2 coordinate elliptic curve) key type.  Implementations need to check that the key type and curve are correct when creating and verifying a signature.  Other documents can define it to work with other curves and points in the future.  </t>
        <t>In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with curve P-256, SHA-384 be used only with curve P-384, and SHA-512 be used with curve P-521.  This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480"/>.  </t>
        <t>
          The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).
          These integers will be the same length as the length of the key used for the signature process.
          The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.
          The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.
          The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC8017"/>, the signature is: 
        </t>
        <t>
          Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n)
        </t>
        <t>
          where n = ceiling(key_length / 8)
        </t>
        <t>When using a COSE key for this algorithm, the following checks are made:
        </t>

        <ul>

          <li>The 'kty' field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present, and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be 'EC2'.</li>

          <li>If the 'alg' field is present, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match the ECDSA signature algorithm being used.</li>

          <li>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include 'sign' when creating an ECDSA signature.</li>

          <li>If the 'key_ops' field is present, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include 'verify' when verifying an ECDSA signature.</li>
        </ul>
        <section>

          <name>Security Considerations</name>
          <t>The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.  </t>
          <t>
            Note: Use of a deterministic signature technique is a good idea even when good random number generation exists. 
            Doing so both reduces the possibility of having the same value of 'k' in two signature operations and allows for reproducible signature values, which helps testing.
          </t>
          <t>There are two substitution attacks that can theoretically be mounted against the ECDSA signature algorithm.
          </t>

          <ul>

            <li>Changing the curve used to validate the signature: If one changes the curve used to validate the signature, then potentially one could have two messages with the same signature, each computed under a different curve.  The only requirement on the new curve is that its order be the same as the old one and it be acceptable to the client.  An example would be to change from using the curve secp256r1 (aka P-256) to using secp256k1.  (Both are 256-bit curves.) We currently do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.  </li>

            <li>Change the hash function used to validate the signature: If one either has two different hash functions of the same length or can truncate a hash function down, then one could potentially find collisions between the hash functions rather than within a single hash function (for example, truncating SHA-512 to 256 bits might collide with a SHA-256 bit hash value). As the hash algorithm is part of the signature algorithm identifier, this attack is mitigated by including a signature algorithm identifier in the protected header bucket.  </li>
          </ul>

        <name>Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (EdDSAs)</name>
        <t><xref target="RFC8032"/> describes the elliptic curve signature scheme Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).  In that document, the signature algorithm is instantiated using parameters for edwards25519 and edwards448 curves.  The document additionally describes two variants of the EdDSA algorithm: Pure EdDSA, where no hash function is applied to the content before signing, and HashEdDSA, where a hash function is applied to the content before signing and the result of that hash function is signed.  For EdDSA, the content to be signed (either the message or the pre-hash value) is processed twice inside of the signature algorithm.  For use with COSE, only the pure EdDSA version is used.  This is because it is not expected that extremely large contents are going to be needed and, based on the arrangement of the message structure, the entire message is going to need to be held in memory in order to create or verify a signature.  This means that there does not appear to be a need to be able to do block updates of the hash, followed by eliminating the message from memory.  Applications can provide the same features by defining the content of the message as a hash value and transporting the COSE object (with the hash value) and the content as separate items.  </t>
        <t>The algorithms defined in this document can be found in <xref target="x-table-eddsa-algs"/>.  A single signature algorithm is defined, which can be used for multiple curves.  </t>

        <t>HMAC <xref target="RFC2104"/> <xref target="RFC4231"/> was designed to deal with length extension attacks.  The algorithm was also designed to allow for new hash algorithms to be directly plugged in without changes to the hash function.  The HMAC design process has been shown as solid since, while the security of hash algorithms such as MD5 has decreased over time; the security of HMAC combined with MD5 has not yet been shown to be compromised <xref target="RFC6151"/>.  </t>
        <t>The HMAC algorithm is parameterized by an inner and outer padding, a hash function (h), and an authentication tag value length.  For this specification, the inner and outer padding are fixed to the values set in <xref target="RFC2104"/>.  The length of the authentication tag corresponds to the difficulty of producing a forgery.  For use in constrained environments, we define one HMAC algorithm that is truncated.  There are currently no known issues with truncation; however, the security strength of the message tag is correspondingly reduced in strength.  When truncating, the leftmost tag length bits are kept and transmitted.  </t>

          <t>HMAC has proved to be resistant to attack even when used with weakened hash algorithms.  The current best known attack is to brute force the key.  This means that key size is going to be directly related to the security of an HMAC operation.  </t>

          <t>A number of attacks exist against Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) that need to be considered.

          </t>

          <ul>

            <li>A single key must only be used for messages of a fixed or known length.  If this is not the case, an attacker will be able to generate a message with a valid tag given two message and tag pairs.  This can be addressed by using different keys for messages of different lengths. 

 The current structure mitigates this problem, as a specific encoding structure that includes lengths is built and signed.  (CMAC also addresses this issue.) </li>

            <li>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, if the same key is used for both encryption and authentication operations, an attacker can produce messages with a valid authentication code.   </li>

            <li>If the IV can be modified, then messages can be forged.  This is addressed by fixing the IV to all zeros.  </li>

          <ul>

            <li>The key and nonce pair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique for every message encrypted.  </li>

          <t>Consideration was given to supporting smaller tag values; the constrained community would desire tag sizes in the 64-bit range. Doing so drastically changes both the maximum messages size (generally not an issue) and the number of times that a key can be used.  Given that Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) is the usual mode for constrained environments, restricted modes are not supported.  </t>

        <name>AES CCM</name>
        <t>CCM is a generic authentication encryption block cipher mode defined in <xref target="RFC3610"/>.  The CCM mode is combined with the AES block encryption algorithm to define a commonly used content encryption algorithm used in constrained devices.  </t>
        <t>The CCM mode has two parameter choices.  The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.  The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message growth (from the tag) and the probability that an attacker can undetectably modify a message.  The second choice is L, the size of the length field.  This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.  </t>
        <t>It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.  This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64 bits and not 8 bits.  These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.  This document will follow the convention of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.  </t>
        <t>We define a matrix of algorithms in this document over the values of L and M.  Constrained devices are usually operating in situations where they use short messages and want to avoid doing recipient-specific cryptographic operations.  This favors smaller values of both L and M.  Less-constrained devices will want to be able to use larger messages and are more willing to generate new keys for every operation.  This favors larger values of L and M.  </t>
        <t>The following values are used for L:
        </t>

        <dl newline="false">
          <dt>16 bits (2):</dt>

          <dd>This limits messages to 2^16 bytes (64 KiB) in length.  This is sufficiently long for messages in the constrained world.  The nonce length is 13 bytes allowing for 2^104 possible values of the nonce without repeating.  </dd>
          <dt>64 bits (8):</dt>

          <dd>This limits messages to 2^64 bytes in length.  The nonce length is 7 bytes allowing for 2^56 possible values of the nonce without repeating.  </dd>

          <dd>This produces a 128-bit authentication tag.  This implies that there is a 1 in 2^128 chance that a modified message will authenticate.  </dd>

It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where portions of the plaintext are  highly predictable.  This reduces the security of the key size by half.  Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.  Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.  Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

        <relref section="&KDFSection;" target="I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct"/> contains a generic description of Key Derivation Functions.
        This document defines a single context structure and a single KDF. 
        These elements are used for all of the recipient algorithms defined in this document that require a KDF process. 
        These algorithms are defined in Sections <xref target="direct-kdf" format="counter"/>, <xref target="ECDH" format="counter"/>, and <xref target="ECDH-wrap" format="counter"/>.

        <name>HMAC-Based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)</name>
        <t>The HKDF key derivation algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC5869"/>.  </t>
        <t>The HKDF algorithm takes these inputs:
        </t>

        <ul empty="true">

          <li>secret -- a shared value that is secret.  Secrets may be either previously shared or derived from operations like a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement.  </li>

          <li>salt -- an optional value that is used to change the generation process.  The salt value can be either public or private.  If the salt is public and carried in the message, then the 'salt' algorithm header parameter defined in <xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/> is used.  While <xref target="RFC5869"/> suggests that the length of the salt be the same as the length of the underlying hash value, any positive salt length will improve the security as different key values will be generated.  This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.  The salt value does not need to be unique for every message sent.  </li>

          <li>length -- the number of bytes of output that need to be generated.  </li>

          <li>context information -- Information that describes the context in which the resulting value will be used.  Making this information specific to the context in which the material is going to be used ensures that the resulting material will always be tied to that usage.  The context structure defined in <xref target="context"/> is used by the KDFs in this document.  </li>

          <li>PRF -- The underlying pseudorandom function to be used in the HKDF algorithm.  The PRF is encoded into the HKDF algorithm selection.  </li>
        </ul>
        <t>HKDF is defined to use HMAC as the underlying PRF.  However, it is possible to use other functions in the same construct to provide a different KDF that is more appropriate in the constrained world.  Specifically, one can use AES-CBC-MAC as the PRF for the expand step, but not for the extract step.  When using a good random shared secret of the correct length, the extract step can be skipped.  For the AES algorithm versions, the extract step is always skipped.  </t>
        <t>The extract step cannot be skipped if the secret is not uniformly random, for example, if it is the result of an ECDH key agreement step. This implies that the AES HKDF version cannot be used with ECDH. If the extract step is skipped, the 'salt' value is not used as part of the HKDF functionality.  </t>
        <t>The algorithms defined in this document are found in <xref target="x-table-hkdf"/>.  </t>

        <name>Context Information Structure</name>
        <t>The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.  The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A"/>.  By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.  This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements, as it is done by the encoding used in JOSE (Section 4.6.2 of <xref target="RFC7518"/>).   </t>
        <t>The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties that are doing the key derivation.  Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.  By doing this association, different keys will be derived for each direction as the context information is different in each direction.  </t>
        <t>The context structure is built from information that is known to both entities.  This information can be obtained from a variety of sources:
        </t>

        <ul>

          <li>Fields can be defined by the application.  This is commonly used to assign fixed names to parties, but it can be used for other items such as nonces.  </li>

          <li>Fields can be defined by usage of the output.  Examples of this are the algorithm and key size that are being generated.  </li>

          <li>Fields can be defined by parameters from the message.  We define a set of header parameters in <xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/> that can be used to carry the values associated with the context structure.  Examples of this are identities and nonce values.  These header parameters are designed to be placed in the unprotected bucket of the recipient structure; they do not need to be in the protected bucket since they already are included in the cryptographic computation by virtue of being included in the context structure. </li>

        <t>We define a CBOR object to hold the context information.  This object is referred to as COSE_KDF_Context.  The object is based on a CBOR array type.  The fields in the array are:
        </t>

        <dl newline="false">
          <dt>AlgorithmID:</dt>
          <dd>
            This field indicates the algorithm for which the key material will be used.
            This normally is either a key wrap algorithm identifier or a content encryption algorithm identifier.
            The values are from the "COSE Algorithms" registry.
            This field is required to be present.
            The field exists in the context information so that a different key is generated for each algorithm even of all of the other context information is the same.
            In practice, this means if algorithm A is broken and thus finding the key is relatively easy, the key derived for algorithm B will not be the same as the key derived for algorithm A.
          </dd>

          <dt>PartyUInfo:</dt>

          <dd>
            <t>This field holds information about party U.  The PartyUInfo is encoded as a CBOR array.  The elements of PartyUInfo are encoded in the order presented below.  The elements of the PartyUInfo array are: 

            </t>

            <dl newline="false">
              <dt>identity:</dt>

              <dd>
                <t>This contains the identity information for party U.  The identities can be assigned in one of two manners.  First, a protocol can assign identities based on roles.  For example, the roles of "client" and "server" may be assigned to different entities in the protocol.  Each entity would then use the correct label for the data they send or receive.  The second way for a protocol to assign identities is to use a name based on a naming system (i.e., DNS, X.509 names). 
 

                </t>
                <t> We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU identity' that can be used to carry identity information in the message.  However, identity information is often known as part of the protocol and can thus be inferred rather than made explicit.  If identity information is carried in the message, applications <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a way of validating the supplied identity information.  The identity information does not need to be specified and is set to nil in that case.  </t>
              </dd>
              <dt>nonce:</dt>

              <dd>
                <t>This contains a nonce value.  The nonce can either be implicit from the protocol or be carried as a value in the unprotected header bucket. 
 

                </t>
                <t> We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU nonce' that can be used to carry this value in the message; however, the nonce value could be determined by the application and the value determined from elsewhere.

                <t> This option does not need to be specified and is set to nil in that case. </t>

              <dt>other:</dt>

              <dd>This contains other information that is defined by the protocol. This option does not need to be specified and is set to nil in that case. </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>
          <dt>PartyVInfo:</dt>

          <dd>This field holds information about party V.  The content of the structure is the same as for the PartyUInfo but for party V.  </dd>
          <dt>SuppPubInfo:</dt>

          <dd>
            <t>This field contains public information that is mutually known to both parties. 

            </t>

            <dl newline="false">
              <dt>keyDataLength:</dt>

              <dd>This is set to the number of bits of the desired output value.  This practice means if algorithm A can use two different key lengths, the key derived for longer key size will not contain the key for shorter key size as a prefix. </dd>
              <dt>protected:</dt>

              <dd>This field contains the protected parameter field.  If there are no elements in the protected field, then use a zero-length bstr.  </dd>
              <dt>other:</dt>

              <dd>This field is for free form data defined by the application.  An example is that an application could define two different byte strings to be placed here to generate different keys for a data stream versus a control stream.  This field is optional and will only be present if the application defines a structure for this information.  Applications that define this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use CBOR to encode the data so that types and lengths are correctly included.  </dd>

          </dd>
          <dt>SuppPrivInfo:</dt>

          <dd>This field contains private information that is mutually known private information.  An example of this information would be a preexisting shared secret.  (This could, for example, be used in combination with an ECDH key agreement to provide a secondary proof of identity.)

            </t>

            <ul>

              <li>These keys need to have some method to be regularly updated over time.  All of the content encryption algorithms specified in this document have limits on how many times a key can be used without significant loss of security.  </li>

              <li>These keys need to be dedicated to a single algorithm.  There have been a number of attacks developed over time when a single key is used for multiple different algorithms.  One example of this is the use of a single key for both the CBC encryption mode and the CBC-MAC authentication mode.  </li>

              <li>Breaking one message means all messages are broken.  If an adversary succeeds in determining the key for a single message, then the key for all messages is also determined.  </li>

        The 'protected' field can be of non-zero length.  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter of the context structure <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present.  The salt/nonce parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically.  The requirement is that it be a unique value for the shared secret in question.  </t>
          <t>If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF.  While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.  If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique, and thus there is no length requirement.  </t>
          <t>A new IV must be used for each message if the same key is used.  The IV can be modified in a predictable manner, a random manner, or an unpredictable manner (i.e., encrypting a counter).  </t>
          <t>The IV used for a key can also be generated from the same HKDF functionality as the key is generated.  If HKDF is used for generating the IV, the algorithm identifier is set to "IV-GENERATION".  </t>

      <section anchor="ECDH">

        <name>Direct ECDH</name>
        <t>The mathematics for ECDH can be found in <xref target="RFC6090"/>.  In this document, the algorithm is extended to be used with the two curves defined in <xref target="RFC7748"/>.  </t>
        <t>ECDH is parameterized by the following: 
        </t>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <t>Curve Type/Curve: The curve selected controls not only the size of the shared secret, but the mathematics for computing the shared secret.  The curve selected also controls how a point in the curve is represented and what happens for the identity points on the curve.  In this specification, we allow for a number of different curves to be used.  A set of curves are defined in <xref target="x-table-ec-curves"/>. 

            </t>
            <t> The math used to obtain the computed secret is based on the curve selected and not on the ECDH algorithm.  For this reason, a new algorithm does not need to be defined for each of the curves.  </t>
          </li>

          <li>Computed Secret to Shared Secret: Once the computed secret is known, the resulting value needs to be converted to a byte string to run the KDF.  The x-coordinate is used for all of the curves defined in this document.  For curves X25519 and X448, the resulting value is used directly as it is a byte string of a known length.  For the P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves, the x-coordinate is run through the I2OSP function defined in <xref target="RFC8017"/>, using the same computation for n as is defined in <xref target="ECDSA"/>.  </li>

          <li>Ephemeral-Static or Static-Static: The key agreement process may be done using either a static or an ephemeral key for the sender's side.  When using ephemeral keys, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> generate a new ephemeral key for every key agreement operation.  The ephemeral key is placed in the 'ephemeral key' parameter and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present for all algorithm identifiers that use ephemeral keys.  When using static keys, the sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either generate a new random value or create a unique value. 
        For the KDFs used, this means either the 'salt' parameter for HKDF (<xref target="HKDF_Alg_Params"/>) or the 'PartyU nonce' parameter for the context structure (<xref target="KDF_Context_Alg_Params"/>) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present (both can be present if desired). The value in the parameter <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be unique for the pair of keys being used.  It is acceptable to use a global counter that is incremented for every static-static operation and use the resulting value.  When using static keys, the static key should be identified to the recipient.  The static key can be identified either by providing the key ('static key') or by providing a key identifier for the static key ('static key id').  Both of these header parameters are defined in <xref target="x-table-ecdh-es-parameter-table"/>.
        </li>

          <li>Key Derivation Algorithm: The result of an ECDH key agreement process does not provide a uniformly random secret.  As such, it needs to be run through a KDF in order to produce a usable key.  Processing the secret through a KDF also allows for the introduction of context material: how the key is going to be used and one-time material for static-static key agreement.  All of the algorithms defined in this document use one of the HKDF algorithms defined in <xref target="HKDF"/> with the context structure defined in <xref target="context"/>.  </li>

          <li>Key Wrap Algorithm: No key wrap algorithm is used.  This is represented in <xref target="x-table-ecdh-es-table"/> as 'none'.  The key size for the context structure is the content layer encryption algorithm size.  </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          COSE does not have an Ephemeral-Ephemeral version defined.
          The reason for this is that COSE is not an online protocol by itself and thus does not have a method to establish ephemeral secrets on both sides.
          The expectation is that a protocol would establish the secrets for both sides, and then they would be used as static-static for the purposes of COSE, or that the protocol would generate a shared secret and a direct encryption would be used.

          <t>
            There is a method of checking that points provided from external entities are valid.
            For the 'EC2' key format, this can be done by checking that the x and y values form a point on the curve.
            For the 'OKP' format, there is no simple way to do point validation.
          </t>
          <t>
            Consideration was given to requiring that the public keys of both entities be provided as part of the key derivation process (as recommended in <relref target="RFC7748" section="6.4"/>). 
            This was not done as COSE is used in a store and forward format rather than in online key exchange. 
            In order for this to be a problem, either the receiver public key has to be chosen maliciously or the sender has to be malicious. 
            In either case, all security evaporates anyway.
          </t>
          <t>A proof of possession of the private key associated with the public key is recommended when a key is moved from untrusted to trusted (either by the end user or by the entity that is responsible for making trust statements on keys). </t>

          <t>The traditional way of sending ECs has been to send either both the x-coordinate and y-coordinate or the x-coordinate and a sign bit for the y-coordinate.

    <section anchor="COSE-Capabilities">
      <name>COSE Capabilities</name>
      <t>
        There are some situations that have been identified where identification of capabilities of an algorithm need to be specified.
        One example of this is in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm"/> where the capabilities of the counter signature algorithm are mixed into the traffic key derivation process.
        This has a counterpart in the S/MIME specifications where SMIMECapabilities is defined in <xref target="RFC8551" section="2.5.2"/>.
        The concept is being pulled forward and defined now for COSE.
      </t>

      <t>
        The algorithm identifier is not part of the capabilities data as it should already be part of message structure.
        There is a presumption in the way that this is laid out is that the algorithm identifier itself is not needed to be a part of this as it is specified in a different location.
      </t>

      <t>
        Two different types of capabilities are defined: capabilities for algorithms and capabilities for key structures. Once defined by registration with IANA, the list of capabilities is immutable.
        If it is later found that a new capability is needed for a key type or an algorithm, it will require that a new code point be assigned to deal with that.
        As a general rule, the capabilities are going to map to algorithm-specific header parameters or key parameters, but they do not need to do so.
        An example of this is the HSS-LMS key capabilities defined below where the hash algorithm used is included.
      </t>
      <t>
        The capability structure is an array of values, the order being dependent on the specific algorithm or key.
        For an algorithm, the first element should always be a key type value, but the items that are specific to a key should not be included in the algorithm capabilities.
        This means that if one wishes to enumerate all of the capabilities for a device which implements ECDH, it requires multiple pairs of capability structures (algorithm, key) to deal with the different key types and curves that are supported.
        For a key, the first element should also be a key type value.
        While this means that this value will be duplicated if both an algorithm and key capability are used, the key type is needed in order to understand the rest of the values.
      </t>

      <name>CBOR Encoding Restrictions</name>
      <t>This document limits the restrictions it imposes on how the CBOR Encoder needs to work.  We have managed to narrow it down to the following restrictions: </t>

      <ul>

        <li>
          The restriction applies to the encoding of the COSE_KDF_Context.
        </li>

        <li>
          Encoding <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be done using definite lengths and the length of the  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the minimum possible length.
          This means that the integer 1 is encoded as "0x01" and not "0x1801".
        </li>

        <li>
          Applications <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> generate messages with the same label used twice as a key in a single map. 
          Applications <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> parse and process messages with the same label used twice as a key in a single map. 
          Applications can enforce the parse and process requirement by using parsers that will fail the parse step or by using parsers that will pass all keys to the application, and the application can perform the check for duplicate keys.

    <section anchor="security-considerations">

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>There are a number of security considerations that need to be taken into account by implementers of this specification.  The security considerations that are specific to an individual algorithm are placed next to the description of the algorithm.  While some considerations have been highlighted here, additional considerations may be found in the documents listed in the references.  </t>
      <t>Implementations need to protect the private key material for any individuals.  There are some cases in this document that need to be highlighted on this issue. 
      </t>

      <ul>

        <li>Using the same key for two different algorithms can leak information about the key.  It is therefore recommended that keys be restricted to a single algorithm.  </li>

        <li>Use of 'direct' as a recipient algorithm combined with a second recipient algorithm exposes the direct key to the second recipient.  </li>

        <li>Several of the algorithms in this document have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without leaking information about the key.  </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The use of ECDH and direct plus KDF (with no key wrap) will not directly lead to the private key being leaked; the one way function of the KDF will prevent that.  There is, however, a different issue that needs to be addressed.  Having two recipients requires that the CEK be shared between two recipients.  The second recipient therefore has a CEK that was derived from material that can be used for the weak proof of origin.  The second recipient could create a message using the same CEK and send it to the first recipient; the first recipient would, for either static-static ECDH or direct plus KDF, make an assumption that the CEK could be used for proof of origin even though it is from the wrong entity.  If the key wrap step is added, then no proof of origin is implied and this is not an issue.  </t>
      <t>Although it has been mentioned before, the use of a single key for multiple algorithms has been demonstrated in some cases to leak information about a key, provide the opportunity for attackers to forge integrity tags, or gain information about encrypted content.  Binding a key to a single algorithm prevents these problems.  Key creators and key consumers are strongly encouraged not only to create new keys for each different algorithm, but to include that selection of algorithm in any distribution of key material and strictly enforce the matching of algorithms in the key structure to algorithms in the message structure.  In addition to checking that algorithms are correct, the key form needs to be checked as well.  Do not use an 'EC2' key where an 'OKP' key is expected.  </t>
      <t>Before using a key for transmission, or before acting on information received, a trust decision on a key needs to be made.  Is the data or action something that the entity associated with the key has a right to see or a right to request? A number of factors are associated with this trust decision.  Some of the ones that are highlighted here are:
      </t>

      <ul>

        <li>What are the permissions associated with the key owner?</li>

        <li>Is the cryptographic algorithm acceptable in the current context?</li>

        <li>Have the restrictions associated with the key, such as algorithm or freshness, been checked and are they correct?</li>

        <li>Is the request something that is reasonable, given the current state of the application?</li>

        <li>Have any security considerations that are part of the message been enforced (as specified by the application or 'crit' parameter)?</li>
      </ul>
      <t>There are a large number of algorithms presented in this document that use nonce values.  For all of the nonces defined in this document, there is some type of restriction on the nonce being a unique value either for a key or for some other conditions.  In all of these cases, there is no known requirement on the nonce being both unique and unpredictable; under these circumstances, it's reasonable to use a counter for creation of the nonce.  In cases where one wants the pattern of the nonce to be unpredictable as well as unique, one can use a key created for that purpose and encrypt the counter to produce the nonce value.  </t>
      <t>One area that has been starting to get exposure is doing traffic analysis of encrypted messages based on the length of the message.  This specification does not provide for a uniform method of providing padding as part of the message structure.  An observer can distinguish between two different messages (for example, 'YES' and 'NO') based on the length for all of the content encryption algorithms that are defined in this document.  This means that it is up to the applications to document how content padding is to be done in order to prevent or discourage such analysis.  (For example, the text strings could be defined as 'YES' and 'NO '.) </t>
