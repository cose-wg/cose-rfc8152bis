## Contributing

See the
[guidelines for contributions](https://github.com/cose-wg/cose-rfc8152bis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that all substantive discussions of issues need to be done on the IETF mailing list and not in the issue tracker.
The issue tracker is still a good place to open issues that need to be discussed.
